# IMPORTANT! 
The files in this folder are not part of our device's final system.
This folder contains files that were used at some point during the development process but were ultimately removed from the final submission. It is not recommended to try and run any of these files as they are not technically a part of our final project. However, we chose to include them to provide additional insight into the design process.
